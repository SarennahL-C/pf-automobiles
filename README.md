### Portfolio
Data science projects I've worked or am working on. Some of these are for fun and curiosity, others come from a data science bootcamp.

# Automobiles
This project was a bootcamp task to perform a thorough EDA on the automobiles [dataset](https://github.com/SarennahL-C/pf-titanic/blob/69a642be9527a974a3509388138ab50eee0b7283/Titanic.csv). To frame my analysis, I decided the context was that I'd been tasked with an analysis of vehicles to suggest a range of executive cars suitable for senior management that are aligned with the new company policy of aggressively reducing environmental impact and costs.
