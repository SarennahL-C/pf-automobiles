### Portfolio
Data science projects I've worked or am working on. Some of these are for fun and curiosity, others come from a data science bootcamp.

# Automobiles
This project was a bootcamp task to perform a thorough EDA on the [automobiles dataset](https://github.com/SarennahL-C/pf-automobiles/blob/06f05070a32629ea79a8ecd6d15d77bc4db9f9e6/automobile.txt). To frame my analysis, I decided the context was that I'd been tasked with an analysis of vehicles to suggest a range of executive cars suitable for senior management that are aligned with the new company policy of aggressively reducing environmental impact and costs. I used a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/SarennahL-C/pf-automobiles/blob/ba34b6b4aa956c40e796f0908f5f1df5a6df56c7/Automobiles_Capstone_Project.ipynb) to perform my analysis and wrote up my work in a [report](https://github.com/SarennahL-C/pf-automobiles/blob/ba34b6b4aa956c40e796f0908f5f1df5a6df56c7/EDA_report_Automobile_Dataset.pdf).

The notebook showcases a range of data cleansing approaches and a variety of plots and seaborn settings to create visually pleasing but informative charts. I received positive [feedback](https://github.com/SarennahL-C/pf-automobiles/blob/ba34b6b4aa956c40e796f0908f5f1df5a6df56c7/capstone_automobiles.jpg) that "This project goes beyond basic cleaning and visualisation, demonstrating advanced analytical thinking through careful variable selection, correlation analysis, and insightful visualisations".
