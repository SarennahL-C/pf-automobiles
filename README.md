### Portfolio
Data science projects I've worked or am working on. Some of these are for fun and curiosity, others come from a data science bootcamp.

# Automobiles
This project was a bootcamp task to perform a thorough EDA on the automobiles [dataset](https://github.com/SarennahL-C/pf-automobiles/blob/06f05070a32629ea79a8ecd6d15d77bc4db9f9e6/automobile.txt). To frame my analysis, I decided the context was that I'd been tasked with an analysis of vehicles to suggest a range of executive cars suitable for senior management that are aligned with the new company policy of aggressively reducing environmental impact and costs. I used a Jupyter Notebook to perform my analysis and wrote up my work in a report.
